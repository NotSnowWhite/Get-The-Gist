# Get-The-Gist         ![License: The MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-lavender)  

The purpose of this repo is to house my first gist.

## Description
  
A gist is quick and easy way to share code and ideas in github. With this repo, I will share my first get about regular expressions and provide an example for further clarity.
  
## Questions 
  
My motivation: My motivation in creating a gist about regex and matching hex values is that I enjoy color theory, so the hex values are fun; and I wanted a place where I could come back to further my knowledge on regex.
  
My reason for creating this: I built this project because colors are always a fun topic and I appreciate good notes. I like the idea of having a place where I can leave my ordered notes and get feedback from my peers without the clutter.
